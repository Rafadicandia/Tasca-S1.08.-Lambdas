## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement
Here is the English translation of the exercises you provided:

***

### **Exercise 1**
From a list of Strings, write a method that returns a list of all the strings that contain the letter 'o'. Print the result.

***

### **Exercise 2**
You have to do the same as in the previous point, but now, the method must return a list with the Strings that, in addition to containing the letter 'o', also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

***

### **Exercise 3**
Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print all the elements of the list with a lambda.

***

### **Exercise 4**
Do the same printing as in the previous point, but using a method reference.

***

### **Exercise 5**
Create a Functional Interface with a method called `getPiValue()` that must return a double. From the `main()` of the main class, instantiate the interface and assign it the value 3.1415. Invoke the `getPiValue()` method and print the result.

***

### **Exercise 6**
Create a list with numbers and text strings and sort the list with the strings from shortest to longest.

***

### **Exercise 7**
With the list from the previous exercise, now sort it in reverse, from the longest string to the shortest.

***

### **Exercise 8**
Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called `reverse()`. This method must receive and return a String. In the `main()` of the main class, inject the body of the method into the created interface using a lambda, so that it returns the same string it receives as a parameter but in reverse. Invoke the instance of the interface, passing it a string, and check if the result is correct.
